# Markdown Parser


My first time using an external library

## Process:


1. Understanding libraries and Tools
 
 - It was my first time i had to use a extrenal tool, I was thinking of creating it on my own, but then I would not have learned to implement other people's code so I decided to go that way


2. I did face some challenges when comunnicating with the tool

- The documentation was very confusing, and it seems it had not been updated for a long time when I was working with it, I was not as seasoned at the time so it also contributed too the confusion. at the end with a little help we were able to figure out the functionality. so it was confusing
